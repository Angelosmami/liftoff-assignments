# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Cooking dinner every night becomes a real chore. Struggling to keep track of what was recently made? Tired of eating the same thing?
wanting to make something new but unsure what to make? Having an app to keep track of past meals or helping
suggest new recipes would be extremely useful to myself as well as other people that I know. The user can sign in, look up recipes based
on what is available on hand or genre of meal they would like to prepare, read comments on found recipes, 
look at meals previously made, as well as being able to create a shopping list when a desired recipe is found. 

I am a wife and mother of two kids. My least favorite time of the day is when it comes time to cook dinner, which happens to be every night.
Ordering out is convenient but gets expensive over time, especially when you order for a family. I always feel as though I cook the 
same things, do not have the time or energy to cook, or just have no idea what to make or what sounds good. I personally would love to
have an application that would help me decide on dinner. Perhaps enter ingredients that I have on hand to give me ideas of things I can 
make or even find a recipe before going shopping and creating a list before I go. 

### Features

### What I'll Have to Learn
While building this project I will have to learn how to utilize data from a public API or web scrapping.
I honestly felt as though Launchcode flew by so fast that there are a lot of things that I will have to
relearn while learning so much more along the way.
